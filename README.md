## About Me

Linux-focused junior systems administrator with hands-on experience building and securing headless systems, server environments, and SSH-based workflows.

Strong interest in Linux administration, networking, virtualization, and real-world infrastructure. All projects are built and documented from scratch with a focus on reproducibility and understanding how systems work under the hood.

Public labs showcase real setups, validation steps, and complete documentation.
