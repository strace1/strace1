## About Me

Linux-focused junior engineer with hands-on experience building and securing
headless systems, remote development environments, and SSH-based workflows.

Strong interest in Linux administration, networking, automation, and
real-world infrastructure. All projects are built and documented from scratch
with a focus on reproducibility and understanding how systems work under the hood.

Public labs showcase real setups, verification steps, and full documentation.
